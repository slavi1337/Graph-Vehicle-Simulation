# Vehicle Simulation
App to simulate real time vehicle movement using a graph structure with nodes representing locations, roads, and intersections. The graph also featured bridges and dynamic routing, where intersections
allowed only specific turning directions. Based on real time traffic data and vehicle parameters, the shortest path was recalculated dynamically, adjusting for congestion. Throughout the simulation, the
system displayed the vehicle’s current position and remaining distance to its destination. At the end of the simulation, detailed reports were generated, including metrics for each vehicle’s journey.
